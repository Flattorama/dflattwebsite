Developer Instructions: Dan Flatt - About Page Implementation

1. Overview & Design Philosophy

Reference Site: Cyd Stumpel About Page
Core Aesthetic: Maximalist typography, high-contrast, playful but executive, fluid scroll-triggered animations.

Key Technical Requirements:

Framework: React / Next.js (Preferred) or plain HTML/GSAP.

Animation Library: GSAP (GreenSock) with ScrollTrigger is highly recommended for the complex header scaling and card fanning effects.

Responsive: All animations must degrade gracefully on mobile (stack vertically instead of fan out if screen width < 768px).

2. Hero Section: "The Floating Orbit"

Visual Layout

Background: Off-white / Cream (matches Cyd's #FFFBF5 or your brand equivalent).

Main Typography: Massive, screen-filling text spanning two lines:

Line 1: DAN

Line 2: FLATT

Style: Heavy Sans-serif (Impact or similar custom font), Color: Brand Red or Electric Blue.

Floating "Bubbles": 4-6 circular elements orbiting/floating around the text.

Animation Specs (The Bubbles)

Content: A mix of static images and animated GIFs/WebMs inside circular masks.

Bubble 1 (GIF): A looping clip of Dan speaking at a podium (Advocacy).

Bubble 2 (Static): High-res headshot smiling.

Bubble 3 (GIF): A rotating 3D wireframe or VR headset (Tech).

Bubble 4 (Static): A gavel or legal scale icon (Law).

Behavior:

Idle: Gentle floating animation (CSS keyframes translateY/X) so they are never perfectly still.

Mouse Interaction: Slight parallax effect on mousemove.

Scroll: Parallax scroll speed (bubbles move faster/slower than the text).

3. Global Scroll Interaction: "The Shrinking Headers"

This is the signature interaction of the reference site.

Logic

As the user scrolls down to a new section (e.g., "About Me", "Services"), the large section title must transition from Part of the content flow to Fixed/Sticky Header.

Initial State: The Section Title (e.g., "ABOUT ME") appears large (approx 8vw font size) in the center of the viewport as you arrive at the section.

Trigger: As the user scrolls past the title.

Action:

The title becomes position: fixed or sticky.

It scales down significantly (from 8vw to ~1.5vw).

It moves to the Top Center of the screen.

Exit: When the user reaches the end of that section, the title scrolls away (un-sticks) or dissolves, replaced by the next section's title which repeats the process.

4. Section 1: "About Me" (Narrative)

Content

Sticky Header Text: "ABOUT ME"

Body Copy (Large, Editorial Style):

"I didn’t just want to argue about the past; I wanted to build the future. I am a Strategic Growth Architect operating at the intersection of structure and chaos. Whether negotiating high-stakes litigation or building VR engines from scratch, I bring the discipline of a lawyer, the efficiency of a consultant, and the hunger of an entrepreneur."

Visuals

The Rotating Portrait: A large rectangular card containing a portrait of Dan.

Animation: As you scroll reading the text, this card should slowly rotate/tilt (3D perspective) based on scroll velocity (skew effect).

5. Section 2: "Services" (The Offering)

Content

Sticky Header Text: "SERVICES"

Layout: Large, bold list (no bullets, just massive text) aligned right or center.

List Items:

FRACTIONAL CMO / GROWTH LEADERSHIP

DIGITAL CORPORATE REPORTING (REACT/D3.JS)

CRISIS MANAGEMENT & ADVOCACY

LEGALTECH WORKFLOW AUTOMATION

Interaction

Hover: When hovering over a service, a relevant image/GIF should appear floating near the cursor (reveal interaction).

6. Section 3: "Ventures" (The Card Stack)

Reference: The "Websites" section on Cyd's site.

Sticky Header Text: "VENTURES"

The Card Stack Animation (CRITICAL)

Initial State: A stack of 3-4 cards (Case Studies) are piled directly on top of each other in the center/right of the screen.

Scroll Action: As the user scrolls down the section, the cards fan out.

Card 1: Rotates -5deg, translates Left.

Card 2: Stays Center.

Card 3: Rotates +5deg, translates Right.

Reverse: Scrolling up causes them to stack back together.

Mobile: Do not fan out horizontally. Stack them vertically with a slight overlap.

Card Content

Card 1 (Sportball):

Visual: Animated GIF of a dashboard counters ticking up (CAC reduction).

Label: "THE TURNAROUND"

Card 2 (Metavrse):

Visual: High-res screenshot of a VR environment or 3D model.

Label: "THE INNOVATION"

Card 3 (Naborino):

Visual: Photo of a community gathering or app UI.

Label: "THE COMMUNITY"

7. Section 4: "Speaking & Advocacy"

Reference: The "Speaking Engagements" section.

Sticky Header Text: "SPEAKING"

Layout & Animation

Left Side: A chaotic "pile" of polaroid-style photos.

Photos: Dan speaking at conferences, Tafsik rallies, tech meetups.

Right Side: Copy text.

Copy: "Sharing knowledge is how we scale impact. From legal boardrooms to tech conferences, I speak on the collision of regulation, innovation, and community resilience."

Animation: The photo pile should shuffle or slightly disperse as the user scrolls past.

8. Section 5: "Recognition" (Awards)

Reference: The "Awards" section.

Sticky Header Text: "RECOGNITION"

Layout

Simple, elegant list with red accent lines separating items.

Content:

Item: SMASHING MAGAZINE - "Person of the Week" (Concept)

Item: TD BANK INNOVATION - "Vendor Partner Award"

Item: SIX SIGMA - "Black Belt Certification"

9. Footer Call to Action

Text: "READY TO BUILD?"

Button: Large, pill-shaped button: "START A PROJECT" (Links to Contact).

Email: "HI@DANFLATT.CA" (Massive text at bottom).
