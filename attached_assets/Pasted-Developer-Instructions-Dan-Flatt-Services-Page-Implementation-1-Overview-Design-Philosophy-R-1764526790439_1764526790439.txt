Developer Instructions: Dan Flatt - Services Page Implementation

1. Overview & Design Philosophy

Reference Site: Cyd Stumpel Services/Work (General Layout Principles)
Core Aesthetic: Clean, executive but high-impact. Text-heavy but broken up by fluid animations and bold interactive cards.

Key Technical Requirements:

Framework: React / Next.js.

Animation Library: GSAP ScrollTrigger.

Navigation: Each service is a "Chapter" on the page. Clicking a Case Study card navigates to the detailed Case Study page.

2. Hero Section: "The Capabilities Engine"

Visual Layout

Background: Off-white / Cream.

Main Typography: Two lines, massive scaling text.

Line 1: GROWTH

Line 2: ARCHITECTURE

Orbiting Elements: Instead of personal photos (like the About page), these are abstract 3D symbols representing the hybrid nature of the work.

Animation Specs (The Bubbles/Orbits)

Symbol 1 (Law): A 3D rendered Paragraph Symbol (¶) or a Gavel, slowly rotating in a wireframe style.

Symbol 2 (Tech): A glowing Code Bracket { } or a low-poly VR Headset.

Symbol 3 (Growth): A rising Green Arrow or a jagged "Stock Chart" line.

Interaction: Mouse movement causes them to drift apart (parallax).

3. Global Interaction: "The Service Index"

Logic:
Unlike the About page which is a narrative flow, this page functions as an "Index."
As the user scrolls, a Sticky Sidebar (Left or Right side) highlights the current section being viewed (e.g., "01. Fractional", "02. Reporting", "03. LegalTech").

4. Service 01: Fractional C-Suite

Sticky Header: "FRACTIONAL CMO"

Copy & Content

Headline: "The Strategic Oversight of a General Counsel. The Aggression of a Startup Founder."

Body Copy:

"Startups and SMEs often face a 'Growing Pain Gap': they need executive strategy but can't justify a full-time C-Suite hire. I bridge that gap. I audit your P&L, restructure your marketing stack, and ensure your growth is legally compliant and operationally sound."

Bullet Points (The Deliverables):

Go-To-Market Strategy Audit
